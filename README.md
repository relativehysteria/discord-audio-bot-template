# Discord audio bot

A template for creating discord bots capable of transmitting audio.

Although it is fully functional like this, it's very bare-bones and (maybe)
overly commented. Honestly, this is a fairly decent proof that too many comments
make the code less readable.

To make this bot run, you have to create a token (there are many guides
splattered throughout the internet on this topic), then put it into a file
called `TOKEN` in this directory and then add the bot to your server.
